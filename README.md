# WildStay - Safari & Hotel Booking

## Project Overview
WildStay is a web application designed for users to find and book luxury hotels and safari experiences. With a focus on user experience and modern design, it offers a seamless booking process integrated with a smooth, responsive layout. Users can explore various destinations, check availability, and book their next adventure directly through the platform.

## Installation
To get started with the WildStay project locally, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/wildstay.git
   cd wildstay
   ```

2. **Open `index.html` in your web browser:**
   Simply locate the `index.html` file and open it using any modern web browser of your choice.

## Usage
Once the project is opened in a browser, you can:

- Navigate through different sections such as Home, Hotels, and Safaris using the navigation bar.
- Use the booking form to check availability for hotels and safaris.
- Explore featured hotels and safari experiences with easy access to booking options.

## Features
- **Responsive Design:** Optimized for both desktop and mobile devices.
- **Smooth Scrolling:** Navigation links enable smooth scrolling to sections.
- **Dynamic Booking Form:** Includes date validation and ensures check-out date is later than check-in date.
- **Featured Listings:** Attractive preview of featured hotels and safaris available for booking.

## Dependencies
The WildStay project utilizes several libraries for styling and icons, which can be found linked within the `index.html` file:

- **Tailwind CSS:** v2.2.19 for styling.
- **Font Awesome:** for icons used in navigation and footer.
- **Google Fonts:** Poppins font family for consistent typography.

These libraries are included via CDN, so no additional installation is required beyond accessing the frontend files.
